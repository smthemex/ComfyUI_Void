Stage 2: VLM Analysis - Identify Affected Objects & Physics
(Cloudflare AI Gateway variant)

Identical to stage2_vlm_analysis.py but routes through the internal CF AI Gateway
instead of calling the Gemini API directly.  Video is sent as sampled frames rather
than a raw video data URL (not supported by the OpenAI-compat endpoint).

Required environment variables:
    CF_PROJECT_ID   - Cloudflare AI Gateway project ID
    CF_USER_ID      - Cloudflare AI Gateway user ID
    MODEL_ID        - Model identifier to use (e.g. "gemini-3-pro-preview")

Usage:
    python stage2_vlm_analysis_cf.py --config my_config_points.json

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTEXT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You will see MULTIPLE inputs:
{grid_context}

Edit instruction: "{instruction}"

IMPORTANT: Some objects may NOT appear in first frame. They may enter later.
Watch the ENTIRE video and note when each object first appears.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Analyze what would happen if the PRIMARY OBJECT (shown in red) is removed.
Watch the ENTIRE video to see all interactions and movements.

STEP 1: IDENTIFY INTEGRAL BELONGINGS (0-3 items)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Items that should be ADDED to the primary removal mask (removed WITH primary object):

✓ INCLUDE:
  • Distinct wearable items: hat, backpack, jacket (if separate/visible)
  • Vehicles/equipment being ridden: bike, skateboard, surfboard, scooter
  • Large carried items that are part of the subject

✗ DO NOT INCLUDE:
  • Generic clothing (shirt, pants, shoes) - already captured with person
  • Held items that could be set down: guitar, cup, phone, tools
  • Objects they're interacting with but not wearing/riding

Examples:
  • Person on bike → integral: "bike"
  • Person with guitar → integral: none (guitar is affected, not integral)
  • Surfer → integral: "surfboard"
  • Boxer → integral: "boxing gloves" (wearable equipment)

STEP 2: IDENTIFY AFFECTED OBJECTS (0-5 objects)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Objects/effects that are SEPARATE from primary but affected by its removal.

CRITICAL: Do NOT include integral belongings from Step 1.

Two categories:

A) VISUAL ARTIFACTS (disappear when primary removed):
   • shadow, reflection, wake, ripples, splash, footprints
   • These vanish completely - no physics needed

   **CRITICAL FOR VISUAL ARTIFACTS:**
   You MUST provide GRID LOCALIZATIONS across the reference frames.
   Keyword segmentation fails to isolate specific shadows/reflections.

   For each visual artifact:
   - Look at each grid reference frame you were shown
   - Identify which grid cells the artifact occupies in EACH frame
   - List all grid cells (row, col) that contain any part of it
   - Be thorough - include ALL touched cells (over-mask is better than under-mask)

   Format:
   {{
     "noun": "shadow",
     "category": "visual_artifact",
     "grid_localizations": [
       {{"frame": 0, "grid_regions": [{{"row": 6, "col": 3}}, {{"row": 6, "col": 4}}, ...]}},
       {{"frame": 5, "grid_regions": [{{"row": 6, "col": 4}}, ...]}},
       // ... for each reference frame shown
     ]
   }}

B) PHYSICAL OBJECTS (may move, fall, or stay):

   CRITICAL - Understand the difference:

   **SUPPORTING vs ACTING ON:**
   • SUPPORTING = holding UP against gravity → object WILL FALL when removed
     Examples: holding guitar, carrying cup, person sitting on chair
     → will_move: TRUE

   • ACTING ON = touching/manipulating but object rests on stable surface → object STAYS
     Examples: hand crushing can (can on table), hand opening can (can on counter),
              hand pushing object (object on floor)
     → will_move: FALSE

   **Key Questions:**
   1. Is the primary object HOLDING THIS UP against gravity?
      - YES → will_move: true, needs_trajectory: true
      - NO → Check next question

   2. Is this object RESTING ON a stable surface (table, floor, counter)?
      - YES → will_move: false (stays on surface when primary removed)
      - NO → will_move: true

   3. Is the primary object DOING an action TO this object?
      - Opening can, crushing can, pushing button, turning knob
      - When primary removed → action STOPS, object stays in current state
      - will_move: false

   **SPECIAL CASE - Object Currently Moving But Should Have Stayed:**
   If primary object CAUSES another object to move (hitting, kicking, throwing):
   - The object is currently moving in the video
   - But WITHOUT primary, it would have stayed at its original position
   - You MUST provide:
     • "currently_moving": true
     • "should_have_stayed": true
     • "original_position_grid": {{"row": R, "col": C}} - Where it started

   Examples:
   - Golf club hits ball → Ball at tee, then flies (mark original tee position)
   - Person kicks soccer ball → Ball on ground, then rolls (mark original ground position)
   - Hand throws object → Object held, then flies (mark original held position)

   Format:
   {{
     "noun": "golf ball",
     "category": "physical",
     "currently_moving": true,
     "should_have_stayed": true,
     "original_position_grid": {{"row": 6, "col": 7}},
     "why": "ball was stationary until club hit it"
   }}

   For each physical object, determine:
   - **will_move**: true ONLY if object will fall/move when support removed
   - **first_appears_frame**: frame number object first appears (0 if from start)
   - **why**: Brief explanation of relationship to primary object

   IF will_move=TRUE, also provide GRID-BASED TRAJECTORY:
   - **object_size_grids**: {{"rows": R, "cols": C}} - How many grid cells object occupies
     IMPORTANT: Add 1 extra cell padding for safety (better to over-mask than under-mask)
     Example: Object looks 2×1 → report as 3×2

   - **trajectory_path**: List of keyframe positions as grid coordinates
     Format: [{{"frame": N, "grid_row": R, "grid_col": C}}, ...]
     - IMPORTANT: First keyframe should be at first_appears_frame (not frame 0 if object appears later!)
     - Provide 3-5 keyframes spanning from first appearance to end
     - (grid_row, grid_col) is the CENTER position of object at that frame
     - Use the yellow grid reference frames to determine positions
     - For objects appearing mid-video: use the grid samples to locate them
     - Example: Object appears at frame 15, falls to bottom
       [{{"frame": 15, "grid_row": 3, "grid_col": 5}},  ← First appearance
        {{"frame": 25, "grid_row": 6, "grid_col": 5}},  ← Mid-fall
        {{"frame": 35, "grid_row": 9, "grid_col": 5}}]  ← On ground

✓ Objects held/carried at ANY point in video
✓ Objects the primary supports or interacts with
✓ Visual effects visible at any time

✗ Background objects never touched
✗ Other people/animals with no contact
✗ Integral belongings (already in Step 1)

STEP 3: SCENE DESCRIPTION
──────────────────────────
Describe scene WITHOUT the primary object (1-2 sentences).
Focus on what remains and any dynamic changes (falling objects, etc).

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
• Watch ENTIRE video before answering
• SUPPORTING vs ACTING ON:
  - Primary HOLDS UP object against gravity → will_move=TRUE (provide grid trajectory)
  - Primary ACTS ON object (crushing, opening) but object on stable surface → will_move=FALSE
  - Object RESTS ON stable surface (table, floor) → will_move=FALSE
• For visual artifacts (shadow, reflection): will_move=false (no trajectory needed)
• For held objects (guitar, cup): will_move=true (MUST provide object_size_grids + trajectory_path)
• For objects on surfaces being acted on (can being crushed, can being opened): will_move=false
• Grid trajectory: Add +1 cell padding to object size (over-mask is better than under-mask)
• Grid trajectory: Use the yellow grid overlay to determine (row, col) positions
• Be conservative - when in doubt, DON'T include
• Output MUST be valid JSON only
