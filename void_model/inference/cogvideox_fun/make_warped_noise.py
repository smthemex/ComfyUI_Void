#Setup:
#    Run this in a Jupyter Notebook on a computer with at least one GPU
#        `sudo apt install ffmpeg git`
#        `pip install rp`
#    The first time you run this it might be a bit slow (it will download necessary models)
#    The `rp` package will take care of installing the rest of the python packages for you
